      <p>
        Card Scammers broadly break into two categories: thems that buy credit
        card data to abuse, and thems that collect credit card data to sell. Of
        the thems that collect data there are two categories Card Skimmers and
        hackers that compromise point of sale systems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4 className="comment-green">### Card Skimmers</h4>
      <p>
        Card skimming can happen{' '}
        <span className="text-color-emphasis">
          with or without physical contact
        </span>
        . Contactless credit cards function based on a device called a retro
        reflector. Essentially it is an antenna and an integrated circuit. When
        exposed to radio waves the retro reflector becomes passively powered and
        transmits a radio signal containing your card information. Card skimming
        can also happen when a{' '}
        <span className="text-color-emphasis">
          disguised physical card reader
        </span>{' '}
        is slid over a read card reader. You swipe your card; the merchant
        processes your transaction and the bad guys have your credit card info.
