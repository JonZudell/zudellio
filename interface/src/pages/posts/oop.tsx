        Objects consist of functions and data. That&apos;s it. Which is a neat
        idea when the alternative is reading{' '}
        <span className="text-color-emphasis">assembly</span> and{' '}
        <span className="text-color-emphasis">registers</span>. Some people
        refer to functions as methods; they are wrong.
